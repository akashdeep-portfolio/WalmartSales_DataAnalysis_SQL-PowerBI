# üìä Walmart Sales Data Analysis

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Walmart sales data to gain insights into
top-performing branches, customer purchasing behavior, and sales trends
across different product lines. By leveraging data analytics, we seek to
optimize sales strategies and improve business decision-making.  
  
The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle Walmart Sales Forecasting
Competition. It contains historical sales data from 45 Walmart stores
across various regions. Each store consists of multiple departments, and
our objective is to analyze trends, identify patterns, and derive
meaningful business insights.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Walmart operates multiple branches with a wide range of products.
However, understanding key drivers of revenue growth, customer behavior,
and seasonal trends remains a challenge. By analyzing historical sales
data, this project aims to answer key business questions such as:

- Which branches and product lines contribute most to revenue?

- What are the peak sales periods and seasonal trends?

- How do different customer segments influence sales?

- Which sales strategies can be optimized to improve profitability?
